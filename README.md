# Personal Portfolio Website
In an effort to differentiate from other job and internship candidates in a competitive field, I created an interactive portfolio experience by using React and SASS to bring my UI designs to life. To ensure flexibility and sustainability for years to come, I designed the site with segmentation and componentization in mind, allowing new experiences and projects to be added with ease.

In addition to the general portfolio site for public visitors, I also ensured the site was extensible to any number of companies and jobs. By utilizing React Router and styled components, I was able to create a unique experience for each company, including a cover letter and custom theming.
