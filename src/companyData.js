Perhaps more importantly than travel, however, good public transportation has a real impact on the residents of a city. Studies show that a well-connected transit network is the number one factor of getting citizens out of poverty, as it provides individuals with access to new opportunities.',
            'But what good are these systems providing if they are not being used to their full extent or are not accessible to the population? That problem is why I am so excited about Transit. It creates a platform to make public transportation more usable in a beautiful way, combining my passions for delightful design and clean code. Because of that, I would love to contribute to the product through a Web Development, UI/UX, or Product Design Internship next summer.'

        motivation: [
            'Growing up, small businesses were all around me. My mother\'s parents owned and operated a small-town pharmacy, my father\'s parents ran a farm and a rural convenience store, and my father continued that spirit of entrepreneurship by starting his own company. Through these family connections, I was instilled early on with an appreciation for small businesses. I love the incredibly valuable product Gusto provides to allow small businesses to take care of their people and get back to doing what they do best.',
            'I feel that Gusto\'s service is more important now than ever, as small businesses have been among those hit the hardest by the pandemic. I would love to add value to the product and the team at Gusto in whatever way possible through an internship position next summer.'

        pitch: [
            'I love making stuff. Whether it is spreadsheets, drawings, brands, or apps, I love being involved in the creative process from start to finish. Being able to see the evolution of a vision from idea to implementation is captivating.',
            'Because I get so excited about creating, it stops being work and starts becoming art. I focus not on how little I am able to get away with but rather on how much I am able to do. Take, for example, this portfolio website. I became so caught up in the project that I sought to go the extra mile. I put in the effort to develop a system that allows for unique experiences for different companies (like the one you are seeing now). I maintained a long-term vision, allowing the site to be extensible for future projects and work experiences.',
            'But beyond mere excitement about creating software products, I also have relevant experience for the position. In addition to software engineering coursework at my university, I have participated in two internships focused on front-end and full-stack web development, respectively. In these experiences, I have gained industry-grade technical skills with JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, and more, in addition to the communication skills that come along with developing in an agile environment.',
            'While my past experiences and educational history provide me with many relevant skills for an internship at Gusto, I also understand that there will inevitably be countless challenges to encounter. As a natural learner, facing the unknown (or rather the not-yet-known) energizes me. In reality, the ability to learn and adapt is perhaps the most relevant skill because it is crucial for a company and a field so heavily focused on solving new and stimulating problems.'

            'Building communities can be an inherently tough thing to do. Although difficult, they are also vital to success and add signficantly to the human experience. One of the most pivotal communities we are apart of is that with our neighbors, purely based on proximity. Those are the people we are most closely surrounded with.',
            'Especially recently, I have noticed that the neighborhoods I have grown up in and those all around the country are merely a group of individuals living near each other. They are not greater than the sum of their parts, as they have the potential to be. Communication is severely lacking and there is little sense of collective belonging.',
            'I love the progress I see Nextdoor making in this space. I would love to contribute to a product that brings people together, and not just online, but in real life. I think Nextdoor is the perfect place for me to do that, and I hope that I am considered for this internship position.'
